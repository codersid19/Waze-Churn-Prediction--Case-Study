# Waze Navigation App- Customer Churn Prediction

## Description
This project focused on predicting and preventing user churn within the app. By analyzing user data, we aim to identify factors contributing to churn and develop strategies to retain users. This project is crucial for improving user retention, driving growth, and guiding data-driven decisions for product development.

1. This dataset contains 82% retained users and 18% churned users.
2. The median user who churned drove 698 kilometers each day they drove last month, which is about 240% of the per-drive-day distance of retained users.
3. The churn rate is highest for people who didn't use Waze much during the last month.
4. The proportion of churned users to retained users is consistent between device types.
5. The t-test results concluded there is not a statistically significant difference in mean number of rides between iPhone users and Android users.
6. recall is essential to this model as it shows the number of churned users.
7. The model has mediocre precision (53% of its positive predictions are correct) but very low recall, with only 9% of churned users identified.
8. The XGBoost model fits the data better than the random forest model.
